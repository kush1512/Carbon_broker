Sequestra - Environmental Project Platform
Project Overview
Sequestra is a conceptual web application designed as a platform for tracking and trading carbon credits from sustainable environmental projects. It provides separate dashboard views for different user roles:

Admin: A government or regulatory body to oversee projects.

NGO: An organization to register and manage environmental projects.

Business: A corporate entity to buy and sell carbon credits to offset emissions.

The platform aims to enhance transparency in the carbon credit market through blockchain technology (conceptually).
